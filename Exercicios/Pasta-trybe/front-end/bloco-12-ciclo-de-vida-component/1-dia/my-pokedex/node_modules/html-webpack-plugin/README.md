  <h1>HTML Webpack Plugin</h1>
  <p>Plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your bundles</p>

<h2 align="center">Install</h2>

<h3>Webpack 5</h3>

```bash
  npm i --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
```

```bash
  yarn add --dev html-webpack-plugin
```


<h3>Webpack 4</h3>

```bash
  npm i --save-dev html-webpack-plugin@4
```

```bash
  yarn add --dev html-webpack-plugin@4
```


This is a [webpack](http://webpack.js.org/) plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your `webpack` bundles. This is especially useful for `webpack` bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation. You can either let the plugin generate an HTML file for you, supply
your own template using `lodash` templates or use your own loader.

Thanks for supporting the ongoing improvements to the html-webpack-plugin!  

<h2 align="center">Zero Config</h2>

The `html-webpack-plugin` works without configuration.  
It's a great addition to the [⚙️ webpack-config-plugins](https://github.com/namics/webpack-config-plugins/blob/master/README.md#zero-config-webpack-dev-server-example).

<h2 align="center">Plugins</h2>

The `html-webpack-plugin` provides [hooks](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#events) to extend it to your needs. There are already some really powerful plugins which can be integrated with zero configuration

 * [webpack-subresource-integrity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-subresource-integrity) for enhanced asset security
 * [appcache-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/lettertwo/appcache-webpack-plugin) for iOS and Android offline usage
 * [favicons-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/favicons-webpack-plugin) which generates favicons and icons for iOS, Android and desktop browsers
 * [html-webpack-harddisk-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-harddisk-plugin) can be used to always write to disk the html file, useful when webpack-dev-server / HMR are being used 
 * [html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin](https://github.com/thegc/html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin) to inline SVGs in the resulting HTML file.
